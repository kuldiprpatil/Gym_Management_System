1. INTRODUCTION TO PROJECT
Our Gym Management Software is a gym membership management system. You can keep records on your members, their memberships, and have quick and easy communication between you and your members. The web based “Gym Management  System” project is an attempt to stimulate the basic concepts of gym management system.
This web application provides lots of functions such data entry of customer, keeping  records of all the things about customer's fees, plan, and physical fitness which help to  provide good quality of services to customer from Gym managers. The system enables  the customer to do the things such as search for monthly plans, choose appropriate diet,choose trainer, save and manage workout related data. The system provides you Quick Search facility that provides you details 
about gym plans without login. But if user want to buy plans then it must require login into your account.The system allows the gym members to schedule their workout time that are suitable for them during the day. The system displays all the plan’s details such as plan no, plan name, price and time of workout, plan duration, trainer etc.Here we provided quick search facility which displays list of available diet  plans and system automatically suggests particular diet plan based on member’s BMI. To subscribe to a plan the system asks the customer to enter his details such as name, address, city, state, weight height and contact number. Then it checks the validity of customer data and books the plan and update the gym database and user database.


1.1 Objective of the Gym Management System:

• The main objective of the project is to develop software that facilitates the data storage, data maintenance and its retrieval for the gym in an igneous way.
• To store the record of the customers, the staff that has the privileges to access, 
modify and delete any record and finally the service, gym provides to its customers. Also, only the admin has the privilege to access any database and 
make the required changes, if necessary.
• To develop easy-to-use software which handles the customer-staff relationship in an effective manner.
• To develop a user friendly system that requires minimal user training. Most of features and function are similar to those on any windows platform.
                                                                   
 1.2 Limitation of Existing system:

• The existing System such as Gym Master is not as much as user (Customer) friendly as compare to our Proposed System. The communication with members 
is not well in Existing System
• All the data is handled by Gym manager. Customers don't get full accessibility to Gym center and all permissions are allowed only for Gym manager. 
• Today's System cannot take effort out of finances and debt collection. Today's systems are time taking software and cannot be easily install in operating system 
like Linux, Vista, Mc-OS, and Novel. And also need high configuration of PC. Normal PC's cannot install in it. Lot of memory space is required for installing 
existing software.Gym Management System
